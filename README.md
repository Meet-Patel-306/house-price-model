# House Price Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of rooms, location, etc.

---

## Project Description

House price prediction is a classic machine learning problem.  
In this project, we build a regression model that learns patterns from historical housing data and predicts prices for new houses.
